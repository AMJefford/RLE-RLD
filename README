To run the run length encoding/decoding, run the file RLE-RLD.c from command line and 
use either the text images Garfield (for RLE) or GarfieldCompressed (for RLD) as the file input. You will 
need a C compiler such as GCC. 
1. gcc RLE-RLD.c
2. gcc -o RLE-RLD RLE-RLD.c
3. RLE-RLD < Garfield.txt
OR 
3. RLE-RLD < GarfieldCompressed.txt

To run the game of life simulation, you will again need a C compiler such as GCC. 

1. gcc GameOfLife.c
2. gcc -o GOL GameOfLife.c
3. GOL 

You will then be asked for an input for the size of the board and the number of simulations to run. 
For example, below shows that the board is 6x6 and wants 20 iterations. Followed by the board input. 
6 6 20
.X...X
X.X.X.
X...X.
X..XX.
..XX.X
...X.X

Once input, the program will begin and complete its simulation to produce the board below. 
...X..
..X.X.
..X.X.
...X..
